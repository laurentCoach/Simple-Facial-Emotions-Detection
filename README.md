# Simple-Facial-Emotions-Detection



### Language 
- Python 3.6

### Libraries
- OpenCV
- Keras

## Project

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can detect a person's facial expressions from a laptop's camera.

1 - Get a dataset which contains images with labels.

In my case I used fer2013 dataset which was used in a kaggle competition in 2013.

2 - Construct a model

Neural Network :  CNN

3 - OpenCV

Load your model and try detection with your camera
