# Simple-Facial-Emotions-Detection



### Language 
- Python 3.6

### Libraries
- OpenCV
- Keras

## Project

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can detect a person's facial expressions from a laptop's camera.

#### Step
1 - Get a dataset which contains images with labels.

In my case I used fer2013 dataset which was used in a kaggle competition in 2013.

2 - Construct a model --> Folder Neural Network

Neural Network :  CNN

3 - Camera Detector --> Folder Camera Detector

Load your model that you developt. Or you can find a model in folder model.

You need to load haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml in opencv.py line 7.

Then launch opencv.yp and try detection with your camera.




### Result
